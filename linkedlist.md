# Linked List

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node points to both the next and the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points to the first node.
