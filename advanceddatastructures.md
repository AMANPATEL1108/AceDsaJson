### Introduction to Advanced Data Structures

**Advanced Data Structures** are complex structures that allow for efficient organization, storage, and retrieval of data. These data structures go beyond the basic ones (like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues) and are designed to handle large amounts of data efficiently, optimizing for both time and space complexities. Understanding these data structures is essential for tackling more complex algorithms and improving overall application performance.

### Key Concepts

1. **Complexity Analysis**: Understanding the time and space complexity of operations (insertion, deletion, searching) on advanced data structures.
2. **Trade-offs**: Evaluating the trade-offs between different data structures for specific use cases (e.g., speed vs. memory usage).
3. **Amortized Analysis**: Understanding average performance over a sequence of operations to assess the efficiency of a data structure.

### Common Advanced Data Structures

1. **Hash Tables**: A structure that implements an associative array, allowing for fast data retrieval based on keys.
2. **Trees**:

   - **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: A tree structure that maintains a sorted order of elements for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
   - **AVL Trees**: A self-balancing BST that ensures O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and searching.
   - **Red-Black Trees**: A balanced BST that maintains balance through color properties, providing efficient performance.
   - **B-Trees and B+ Trees**: Used in databases and file systems for efficient data storage and retrieval.

3. **Heaps**:

   - **Binary Heap**: A complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property (max-heap or min-heap), useful for priority queues.
   - **Fibonacci Heap**: A more complex heap structure that provides better amortized performance for decrease-key and delete operations.

4. **Graphs**: Data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that represent relationships; can be directed or undirected.

5. **Tries**: A tree-like data structure that stores a dynamic set of strings, allowing for efficient retrieval based on prefixes.

### Implementation of Advanced Data Structures in Java

#### 1. Hash Table

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class HashTableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        map.put("Alice", 30);
        map.put("Bob", 25);

        System.out.println("Alice's age: " + map.get("Alice")); // Output: Alice's age: 30
    }
}
```

#### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)

```java
class TreeNode {
    int value;
    TreeNode left, right;

    TreeNode(int item) {
        value = item;
        left = right = null;
    }
}

public class BST {
    TreeNode root;

    // Insert a new value
    void insert(int value) {
        root = insertRec(root, value);
    }

    TreeNode insertRec(TreeNode root, int value) {
        if (root == null) {
            root = new TreeNode(value);
            return root;
        }
        if (value < root.value)
            root.left = insertRec(root.left, value);
        else if (value > root.value)
            root.right = insertRec(root.right, value);
        return root;
    }
}
```

#### 3. AVL Tree

```java
class AVLNode {
    int key, height;
    AVLNode left, right;

    AVLNode(int d) {
        key = d;
        height = 1;
    }
}

public class AVLTree {
    AVLNode root;

    int getHeight(AVLNode N) {
        return (N == null) ? 0 : N.height;
    }

    // Rotate right
    AVLNode rightRotate(AVLNode y) {
        AVLNode x = y.left;
        AVLNode T2 = x.right;

        x.right = y;
        y.left = T2;

        y.height = Math.max(getHeight(y.left), getHeight(y.right)) + 1;
        x.height = Math.max(getHeight(x.left), getHeight(x.right)) + 1;

        return x;
    }

    // Rotate left
    AVLNode leftRotate(AVLNode x) {
        AVLNode y = x.right;
        AVLNode T2 = y.left;

        y.left = x;
        x.right = T2;

        x.height = Math.max(getHeight(x.left), getHeight(x.right)) + 1;
        y.height = Math.max(getHeight(y.left), getHeight(y.right)) + 1;

        return y;
    }

    // Insert a value
    AVLNode insert(AVLNode node, int key) {
        if (node == null) return new AVLNode(key);
        if (key < node.key) node.left = insert(node.left, key);
        else if (key > node.key) node.right = insert(node.right, key);
        else return node; // Duplicate keys are not allowed

        node.height = 1 + Math.max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right)));

        // Balance the tree
        return balance(node);
    }
}
```

#### 4. Trie

```java
class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
    boolean isEndOfWord;

    public TrieNode() {
        isEndOfWord = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            children[i] = null;
        }
    }
}

public class Trie {
    private final TrieNode root;

    public Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    void insert(String key) {
        TrieNode pCrawl = root;
        for (char c : key.toCharArray()) {
            if (pCrawl.children[c - 'a'] == null) {
                pCrawl.children[c - 'a'] = new TrieNode();
            }
            pCrawl = pCrawl.children[c - 'a'];
        }
        pCrawl.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
}
```
